This project is a console-based implementation of a Petri Net, a mathematical modeling tool for analyzing systems with concurrent processes. This implementation allows users to define their own Petri Nets and visualize the flow of tokens between transitions and places in the net.

Requirements: C++ compiler

Installation:
  1. Clone the repository to your local machine
  2. Compile the program with your C++ compiler
 
In the terminal, type the following command to compile your code using g++:
g++ main.cpp -o <executable_name>

After the compilation is successful, you can run your code by typing the following command in the terminal:
./<executable_name>

You can run directly by main.exe
